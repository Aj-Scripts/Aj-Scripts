### Hi, I’m @Aj-Scripts 👋

- 🧑‍💻 I’m interested in coding... probably. (Still deciding if I’m the next tech wizard or just really good at Googling things.)
- 📚 I’m currently learning... how to pretend I know what I’m doing. (But seriously, it's probably something cool like JavaScript or Python.)
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on... anything that doesn't require me to wake up before 9 AM. (I'm a night owl, deal with it.)
- 📫 How to reach me... just yell "AJ!" really loud. (Or, you know, email works too.)
- 🏷 Pronouns: He/Him/That Guy Over There (Yes, that’s me.)
- 🎉 Fun fact: all the things u just read was ai generated (thanks gpt).
